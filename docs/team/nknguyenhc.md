### Project: NetworkBook

NetworkBook is a desktop contact book application. It aims to help computing students and professionals from NUS to network with each other. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Add an email to a person.
The command adds the new email to the target person's current list of emails.
The email regex ensures that `@` is present, and at least one `.` is present in the domain part.
Pull request: [#86](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-2/tp/pull/86)

* **New Feature**: Add a link to a person.
The link can be the person's social page or personal website.
The link regex accommodates for links that consist of domain, and optionally pathname and query parameters, while ensuring that most of the URL standards are not violated (which suggests the URL's invalidity).
The command adds the new link to the target person's current list of links.
Pull request: [#88](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-2/tp/pull/88)

* **Enhancement to an existing feature**: Edit a person's details.
Any contact detalls editable.
The edit feature makes effective use of the `UniqueList` class to enforce the uniqueness constraint on person's name within the contact list, and field values within the same list (e.g. unique phone numbers within a contact's phone list).
The edit feature also ensures the new value adheres to the constraint(s) of the field type.
The edit feature makes effective use of the `UniqueList` class to ensure the validity of the indices.
For e.g. `edit 1 /phone 12345678 /index 2` assigns the value of `12345678` to the phone number at index 2 in the phone list of contact at index 1.
Pull request: [#122](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-2/tp/pull/122)

* **New Feature**: Open a contact's link from the app.
The feature allows the user to easily to open a contact link with the  `open` command.
The code used to pop up the browser had to be customised for each of the three OS'es, Windows, Mac OS and Ubuntu.
The command pops up the user's default browser directed to the link.
Pull request: [#152](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-2/tp/pull/152)

* **New Feature**: Open a window for a new email to a contact's email address.
The feature allows the user to easily start sending an email to a contact with the `email` command.
The code used to pop up the browser had to be customised for each of the three OS'es, Windows, Mac OS and Ubuntu.
The command pops up the user's default mailbox application, with a new email draft created and the recipient prefilled with the contact's email address.
Pull request: [#161](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-2/tp/pull/161)

* **Design implementation**: Generalised `UniquePersonList` to `UniqueList`, which is also used in the implementation of many fields of the `Person` class, including phone, email, link, course, specialisation and tag.
The `UniqueList` class is a generic class that allows identity checking of the generic type `T`, by enforcing that `T` implements the `Identifiable<T>` interface.
Pull request: [#79](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-2/tp/pull/79)

* **Code refactoring**: Refactored the entire code base, changing the package name from `seedu.address` to `networkbook`.
This involves exhaustive changes in class names and test case names.
Pull request: [#77](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-2/tp/pull/77)

* **Bug fix**: Ensured that any kind of malformed JSON and lack of write permission in the data file, preference file, config file and log file do not cause the application to crash upon launch.
This involves a null check on objects of classes that are convertible from JSON,
and a duplicate check on any list in the data file that are supposed to conform to the uniqueness constraint.
