## Product Overview

**Land the dream internship or job opportunity you've always wanted by networking more effectively using _NetworkBook!_**

_NetworkBook_ is a **desktop contact book application** built for NUS Computing students and professionals to manage information about the people they network with more efficiently than ever before.

Here's an overview of how _NetworkBook_ can help you manage your network of contacts better than existing alternatives:

* **Search** for and **sort** contacts by multiple networking-relevant fields (e.g. priority, courses taken/taking, specialization(s) taken/intending to take, graduation year)
* Access this application **offline**, with a static online page that contains user manual and download link
* Record only the information you find **relevant** on our application (e.g. you can assign one contact only their email and specialisation, and another contact nothing but their course)

On top of these advantages, we believe that contact management must be **efficient**. Therefore, _NetworkBook_ is optimised for use via fully text based commands while still having an interactive and user-friendly visual interface. For fast typers, _NetworkBook_ can get your contact managing done faster than existing alternatives performing a similar role.

## Features

### Contact Fields

Many commands in _NetworkBook_ allow you to specify a particular **field** (piece of information) of a contact to operate on. This section lists all of the available fields, as well as how you can specify them in commands.

<!-- @@author Singa-Pirate -->

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Fields and prefixes**

Each field in _NetworkBook_ has a corresponding **prefix**. To specify a field in your command, follow the format of `[field prefix] [field value]`, e.g. `/name Tom`.

Some fields are **single-valued fields**, meaning that each contact has **only 1 value** for each of these fields.

| Single-valued fields | Prefix    | Value format                                                 | Remarks                                                      |
| -------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| name                 | /name     | Any non-empty value comprising alphanumeric characters (and spaces, if any) | If a contact's name contains non-alphanumeric characters (e.g. `/`), you may omit these characters in the name that you store. |
| priority level       | /priority | Either `high`, `medium` or `low`, or the initial alphabet    | Not case-sensitive                                           |
| graduation semester  | /grad     | `AYxxxx-Sy`<br/><br/>e.g., `AY2223-S1` for Academic Year 20`22`/20`23` Semester `1` | `xxxx` is the 4-digit representation of 2 **consecutive** calendar years.<br/>Academic year must be between AY1970/1971 to AY2069/2070 (inclusive). <br/>`y` is either `1` for Semester 1, or `2` for Semester 2. |

<div style="break-after:page"></div>

Other fields are **multi-valued fields**. Each contact has a **list** of different values for each of these fields.
<br/>

| Multi-valued fields | Prefix  | Value format                                            | Remarks                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| phone numbers       | /phone  | Valid phone number containing numbers and optional country code (1-3 numbers with `+` in front) if applicable | Phone number body (excluding country code) must be at least 3 digits long.<br/>Phone numbers with and without whitespace character are treated as different (e.g. `+6512345678` is different from `+65 12345678`). |
| email addresses     | /email  | Valid email with `@` (at sign) and `.` (period) present after `@` |-|
| links        | /link   | Valid URL link                                               | Link must be URL-encoded. That is, it must be the same as the URL that appears on the browser's URL bar after you visit the page. |
| courses             | /course | `course_name [/start date] [/end date]` <br/><br/>e.g., `CS2103T /start 01-09-2023 /end 01-12-2023` |`/start` and `/end` indicate when the contact started and finished taking the course respectively. <br/>A course can have no dates, a start date, or a start and end date.|
| specialisations     | /spec   | Any non-empty value                                          |-|
| tags                | /tag    | Any non-empty value                                          |-|

In _NetworkBook_, you can manage contact information by changing the fields assigned to them. Following are the commands you can use to manage fields of a contact:


| Command                                                          | How does it manage the fields                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| [create](#create-new-contact-create-name-name-optional-fields)   | optionally initialise certain fields when creating new contact |
| [add](#add-details-to-contact-add-index-fields)                  | add more details to a field of a contact                       |
| [edit](#edit-contact-detail-edit-index-field-options)            | update some details about a field of a contact                 |
| [delete](#delete-some-details-delete-index-field-prefix-options) | delete some details from a field of a contact                  |

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">
<span id="indices">:bulb: **Indices**</span>

In _NetworkBook_, you often need to provide an index to specify a contact, or an entry in a multi-valued field of a contact. Indices are **integers counted from 1**.

Make sure to provide indices that have a corresponding item in your _NetworkBook_. If your command contains an invalid index, an error message will be shown.

### <u>Category 1 - Manage contact information</u>

This category focuses on storing and modifying a contact list. It involves specific commands that allow you to **add, edit** and **delete** contact information. Relevant commands and explanations of their functionalities are outlined below:

#### Create new contact: `create /name [name] [optional fields]`

You can use the `create` command to create a new contact. When creating a contact, you must provide the name field, and it is optional to provide other fields which will be added to the new contact.

**Format:** `create /name [name] [optional field prefix] [optional field value] ...`
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
**Parameters:**

* `[name]`  is the name of the contact you wish to add.
* `[optional fields]` are **non-mandatory fields** you can associate with the contact at the point of creation.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Non-mandatory fields** you can associate with a contact at the point of creation comprise the contact's `phones`, `emails`, `links`, `graduation semester`, `courses`, `specialisations`, `tags` and `priority level`. (These fields can also be subsequently added to the contact using the `add` command.)

To view a comprehensive list of fields and their prefixes, go to the [Contact Fields section](#contact-fields).
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:bulb: When creating a contact, if there is already another contact with the same name, you would be informed that another contact with the same name already exists (not case sensitive).

</div>

**Example usage:**

* `create /name Jiale /phone 12345678 /grad AY2526-S2`

    &nbsp;
    <img src="images/create/create.png" width="600">

    In the screenshot above, the contact "Jiale" has been created. Jiale's index number depends on the list's current sorting - in this case, "Jiale" is #6 when sorted by name.
    &nbsp;

* `create /name Jiale`

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

<div style="break-after:page"></div> 

#### Add details to contact: `add [index] [fields]`

You can use the `add` command to add contact details under fields associated with an existing contact. No new contact will be created.

**Format:** `add [index] [field prefix] [field value] ...`

**Parameters:**

* `[index]` is the [index](#indices) of the contact in the list.
* `[field prefix]` specifies the corresponding field to add.
* `[field value]` is the value to add to the field specified by the preceding prefix.

You can add multiple fields with one `add` command by entering multiple sets of `[field prefix]` and `[field value]`.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: Fields you can add contact details to for an existing contact comprise the contact's `phones`, `emails`, `links`, `graduation semester`, `courses`, `specialisations`, `tags` and `priority level`.

To view a comprehensive list of fields and their prefixes, go to the [Contact Fields section](#contact-fields).

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:bulb: This command ignores any input field values that are already present in your target contact.
For example, if your contact at index `1` already has the phone number `12345678`, the command `add 1 /phone 12345678` does nothing.
</div>

<div style="break-after:page"></div>

**Example usage:**

* `add 1 /phone 91234567`

    &nbsp;
    <img src="images/add-remark/add-phone.png" width="600">

    In the screenshot above, the phone number `91234567` has been added to contact #1 (Alex Yeoh).

### <u>Category 3 - Miscellaneous commands</u>

This category covers miscellaneous commands for **additional functionalities** in _NetworkBook_. Relevant commands and explanations of their functionalities are outlined below:

#### Undo last change to _NetworkBook_: `undo`

You can use the `undo` command to undo the last change to the list of contacts stored in _NetworkBook_ and/or the list of contacts displayed by _NetworkBook_, so that you can quickly revert mistaken/temporary _NetworkBook_ commands (excluding `undo`). This command can only undo changes made in your current session on _NetworkBook_.

**Format:** `undo`

**Parameters:** N/A

**Example usage:**

* `undo`

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Redo last undone change: `redo`

You can use the `redo` command to redo the last change to the list of contacts stored in _NetworkBook_ and/or the list of contacts displayed by _NetworkBook_, so that you can quickly revert mistaken/temporary `undo` commands. This command only works if you have previously used `undo` commands in _NetworkBook_ that can be reversed.

**Format:** `redo`

**Parameters:** N/A

**Example usage:**

* `redo`

You may need to manually save if _NetworkBook_'s permission to write to the data file is compromised.
</div>


**Format:** `save`

**Parameters:** N/A

**Example usage:**

* `save`

#### Exit _NetworkBook_: `exit`

### <u>Category 4 - Accessibility features</u>

This category introduces available interactions using **keyboard** and **mouse** that add more scaffolding to your networking experience. Relevant features are outlined below:

### Keyboard shortcuts

_NetworkBook_ supports many convenient keyboard shortcuts for you to execute commands efficiently.

#### Auto-fill command preamble: `ctrl-F/N/G/U/R`

When typing in the command box, if the command box is empty, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts to **auto-fill** the first word of some commands:

* `ctrl-F`: auto-fill with `find`
* `ctrl-N`: auto-fill with `create`
* `ctrl-G`: auto-fill with `edit`
* `ctrl-U`: auto-fill with `undo`
* `ctrl-R`: auto-fill with `redo`

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Navigate command history: `Up/Down arrow keys`

When typing in the command box, you can use the arrow keys to fill the command box with a **previously executed command**.

* `Up arrow key`: navigate back to the previous command in the history, if any.
* `Down arrow key`: navigate forth to the next command in the history, if any.

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Undo/redo last change: `ctrl-Z/Y`

When not typing in the command box, you can use the following shortcuts to quickly execute an `undo` or `redo` command.

* `ctrl-Z`: **undo** last change to _NetworkBook_ (equivalent to [`undo` command](#undo-last-change-to-networkbook-undo))
* `ctrl-Y`: **redo** last change undone (equivalent to [`redo` command](#redo-last-undone-change-redo))

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:bulb: **Note:**
These shortcuts only work when the command box is not active. If you are typing in the command box, these shortcuts will be used to undo or redo changes made to the command text.

</div>

[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

#### Other useful shortcuts: `ctrl-S/W`, `F1`

* `ctrl-S`: manually **save** to data file (equivalent to [`save` command](#manually-save-to-data-file-save))
* `ctrl-W`: **exit** _NetworkBook_ (equivalent to [`exit` command](#exit-networkbook-exit))
* `F1`: view **help** window (equivalent to [`help` command](#view-help-window-help))

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:bulb: **Note:**

If the `F1` key is bound to a different function in your computer settings, the keyboard shortcut to view help window may not work as expected.

### Mouse interaction

While _NetworkBook_ is optimised for use with keyboards and text commands, it also has buttons you can click to execute certain commands.

#### Filter (equivalent to [`filter` command](#filter-contacts-list-filter-by-field-with-term))

You can click on a contact's tag, course, graduation, or specialisation to **view all contacts** with the **same** tag/course/graduation/specialisation.

#### Open link (equivalent to [`open` command](#open-a-contacts-link-open-index-index-link-index))

You can click on a contact's link to **open the link** in your web browser.

#### Email contact (equivalent to [`email` command](#send-email-to-a-contacts-email-address-email-index-index-email-index))

You can click on a contact's email address to **draft an email** to the contact.

## FAQ

### Launching _NetworkBook_

**Q:** How can I launch _NetworkBook_ if the clicking on the JAR file does not work on my Windows computer? <br/>
**A:** If you are familiar with the command prompt, you can follow the steps below:

1. Open command prompt on your computer
1. Navigate to the directory where the JAR file is located using `cd [JAR file location]`
1. Type `java -jar networkbook.jar` and press enter
1. _NetworkBook_ should launch

If you have any further issues, please raise an issue on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T08-2/tp). We will attend to you as soon as we can.

### Checking Java version

**Q:** How can I check my Java version? <br/>
**A:** Open command prompt (Windows) or terminal (MacOS or Linux) on your computer, and type `java -version`. If you do not have Java installed, you can download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11).

### Loading data from another device

**Q:** How can I load my contacts stored in _NetworkBook_ used in another device? <br/>
**A:** Locate the data file stored at `[JAR file location]/data/networkbook.json`. Copy over the data file to the corresponding location on your current device. After that, launch _NetworkBook_ to check whether your contact details have been loaded properly.

### Editing data file manually

**Q:** Can I edit the data file for _NetworkBook_ manually (i.e. from outside the _NetworkBook_ app)? <br/>
**A:** You can edit the data file for _NetworkBook_ manually, but at your own risk (if there are errors in the file related to formatting/invalid data, the app will not read the data file and begin from an empty data file instead.)
